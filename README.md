# Dance-Coordination-Checker---IS-Internship
This project helps check the coordination of dance between two dancers with the same choreography and furnishes dynamic graphical plots for visualisation.
The dance_tracker.py file contains the code for preprocessing the video and calculating all the necessary measurements required for coordination checking along with playing the videos side by side.
The comparison_main.py file contains the code for calling the services from dance_tracker.py and using it to plot the graphs for the trends in their dances.
